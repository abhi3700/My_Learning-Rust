# Web Scrapping

## Overview

Web scraping is a popular technique for gathering large amounts of data from web pages quickly and efficiently. If an API for the data you need is unavailable, web scraping can be the next-best approach.

Rustâ€™s speed and memory safety make the language ideal for building web scrapers. Rust is home to many powerful parsing and data extraction libraries, and its robust error-handling capabilities are handy for efficient and reliable web data collection

## Installation
