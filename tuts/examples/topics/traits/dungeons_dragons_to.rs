/// let's have a collection - spellbook which stores all the spells

/// so as to remove the runtime cost as everything is known at compile time.
///
/// But, there would have been a lot of code duplication. Therefore, to reduce
/// the code size, `dyn Cast` is used.

/// Summary:
/// - `impl Trait` or Generic has although more code size, but has no runtime cost.
/// - `dyn Trait` is used to have lesser code size, but has runtime cost.
