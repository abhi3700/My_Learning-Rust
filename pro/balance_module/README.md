# Balance Module

A simple balance module showing development from simple to generics with trait bounds implementation.

> Very useful for substrate learning.

## Overview

- step 1: simple implementation
- step 2: add hardcoded types
- step 3: transform the struct to a generic one & then add trait bounds (wherever required)
- test cases are written as well in `tests/` folder.

## Build

```bash
cargo build
```

> To do a release build use `cargo build --release`

## Test

```bash
cargo test
```

> to add watch use `cargo watch -x test`
